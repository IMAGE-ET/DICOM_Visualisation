{"name":"Dicom visualisation","tagline":"Segmentation tool for DICOM files","body":"### Welcome to Segmentation tool for DICOM files.\r\nThis project is eventually going to be open-sourced, so patience young-padawan. The idea is to build and develop a solid code base which can be built upon by you guys. One of the current problems with current segmentation software is its GUI, so i've take away the GUI... sort of. I'm using OpenGL rather than VTK, performance is increased whilst being a dedicated graphics language. This makes it challenging to develop for, but the advantages are that the source code is built by developers and not users. ITK is the segmentation library being used, including its rescaling and histogram functions. The final goal is to create a GUI once all of the functionality has been developed. No more confusing interfaces!!\r\n\r\nSo Hello, Welcome and Patience\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis started as an undergraduate dissertation project by Craig Parkinson (@cpkson) in 2013.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nparkcra@gmail.com\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
